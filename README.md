# CS-370_Course
Portfolio for SNHU's CS 370: Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science, taken September - October 2023, focused on artificial intelligence and neural networks. 

_Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?_
    For this project, most of the code was provided. I finished the code in cell #9, specifically the for loop for each epoch.

_Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:_
_What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?_
    Computer scientists design and create the software that increasingly runs our world. As technology advances, so does the continued need for those who will create the software that keeps the lights running, our money accessible and safe, our food plentiful and our minds educated and entertained. Without computer scientists, our world would regress to a world without many of the modern conveniences and wonders.
    

_How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?_
    Like any scientist, this first step is to establish a question. Sometimes this might be a problem to solve, a product to create, or an improvement on something that already exists. The next step is to establish the parameters to answer that question. Once parameters are established, the next step is research. Sometimes the solution already exists, possibly an existing solution might need tweaking or an entirely new solution developed. Finally, once the question is examined and researched, that knowledge must be put to use. This might mean developing something new, adjusting an already existing thing, or implementing an already existing solution.

_What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?_
    There are a number of ethical codes which a computer scientist may subscribe to. But they boil down to doing no harm. Sometimes this means ensuring the protection of the user's or organization's data. Sometimes it might mean ensuring the software operates in it's most efficient way. Other times it might mean ensuring the software works as intended and claimed.
